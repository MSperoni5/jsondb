## Lua script to manage a database using JSON files as a data store.
Lua script to manage a database using JSON files as a data store. Add, edit, delete and query data in a simple and intuitive way. Perfect for Lua projects that require lightweight and flexible data management.
To enhance your database visualization experience, I recommend using the tool [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/). You can find it as an extension on [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AykutSarac.jsoncrack-vscode) or directly from their website.
