To enhance your database visualization experience, I recommend using the tool [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/). You can find it as an extension on [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AykutSarac.jsoncrack-vscode) or directly from their website.

### Features
- Easy usage of a simple and fast database.
- Easily exportable for convenient usage.
- Alternative to Fivem's key-value pairs (kvp).
- Open source.
- Comprehensive documentation and guides to help users get started and make the most of the tool.
- Regular updates and improvements to ensure compatibility with the latest JSON standards and best practices.

Installation guide for the jsondb resource:

2. Navigate to the "resources" folder.
3. Copy the jsondb resource folder into the "resources" folder of your server.
4. Add the jsondb resource to your server configuration file (`server.cfg`). You can do this by adding a line similar to the following:
